      # Scenario Editor

      The Scenario Editor is a graphical interface that allows a user to create objects in
      categories, and to assign values to those objects' attributes, in a dynamic web form
      interface.

      The Scenario Editor is perfect for testing your encoding by quickly generating fact
      scenarios and seeing if they behave as expected.

      ## Controlling Access to Scenario Editor

      If your project is not published, only the owner of the project will be able to run
      the Scenario Editor from inside the test interface. If your project is set to published in the
      Rule Editor screen, the scenario editor for all of your tests will be available to
      unauthenticated users.

      To allow users other than yourself to use Scenario Editor with your encoding and tests, you must
      set the Project to "Published".

      ## Starting Scenario Editor

      ![Scenario Editor Button](/static/blawx/docs/images/scenario_editor_button.png)

      To start the Scenario Editor, click on the "Scenario Editor" button in the test editor screen.

      You will be taken to a user interface with a button bar across the top, a fact scenario form on
      the left, and answers on the right.

      ## Buttons

      ![Scenario Editor Buttons](/static/blawx/docs/images/scenario_editor_buttons.png)

      The buttons available in the BlawxBot interface are:

      * Run - this runs the test with the currently defined fact scenario
      * Help - opens the Blawx documentation in a different window
      * Exit - Closes the Scenario Editor and returns you to the test editor for the same test.

      ## Answers

      The right side of the scenario editor will display answers that Blawx can find, with
      all the explanations for those answers, in a format similar to the output of the test
      editor.

      ## Fact Scenario Editor

       ![Fact Scenario Editor Interface](/static/blawx/docs/images/fact_scenario_editor_interface.png)

      The main interface in the scenario editor page is the fact scenario editor form.

      The form is a nested tree. At the far left of the form you will see a list of the categories
      that exist in your test. By clicking the "add" button with the plus icon, you can create
      a new object in that category and give it a name.
      
      ![Add Button](/static/blawx/docs/images/add_button.png)

      Note that names of objects must begin with a lowercase letter, cannot include spaces, and must be
      unique. These requirements are not yet enforced by the Scenario Editor.

      If you create an object, you will be able to expand the category by clicking on the "arrow" icon
      to view the objects inside it.
      The name of the objects you create can be changed in the interface. If you expand an object in the
      same way, you will see the attributes that can be set for that object.

      You can add a value to an object's attribute by clicking the "add" button on the attribute name inside the object.
      

      Values can be edited after they have been created, also.

      Values and objects can be deleted by clicking on the delete button with the "trash can" icon on the right side.
      
      ![Delete Button](/static/blawx/docs/images/delete_button.png)
      
      You cannot delete categories, or attributes. Note that if your test or your encoding defines any objects, and the
      attributes of those objects, they will also appear in your fact scenario editor form, but you will not be able
      to modify or delete them.

      When setting the value of an attribute that has a category as it's type (for example, "friend" might be an attribute
      of a person, and also refer to other persons), the interface will allow you to choose from the objects that already
      exist in the target category. To refer to an object, it must be included in the category first. So for example,
      if you want to say that jason and june are friends, you must first create both jason and june in the category "person",
      and then in the "friend" attribute of june, add jason as a value.

      ## Assumptions

      ![Lock Button](/static/blawx/docs/images/lock_button.png)

      In the Scenario Editor, every category and attribute has a "lock" button. It starts in the "unlocked" position, and if
      you click on it, it switches to the "locked" position, and back again.  If the button is in the "locked" position, it
      is not possible to add objects to that category, or values to that object's attribute.

      However, the lock icon has another more important function. It tells the reasoner which assumptions you would like it to make.

      If you leave the lock "open" on a category (let's say "person"), that is equivalent to writing code that says "assume {X} is in the category person".
      It allows Blawx to hypothesize the existence of additional members of that category in order to attempt to answer the question.

      Similarly, if you leave the lock "open" on an object's attribute (let's say the "friend" attribute of the "bob" object), that
      is equivalent to writing code that says "assume {X} is a friend of {bob}".

      This is a very powerful and straightforward way of generating two kinds of assumptions that Blawx is capable of using.

      # Tips

      ## Known Problems

      Scenario Editor is a very new feature, and there are a number of known issues:

      * It tends to return and display duplicate explanations
      * Clicking on a button may not work if you are editing an object name, you may need to click twice.
      * Support for attributes with values that are numbers, dates, and durations is under development.

      ## Lock Your Lists

      Usually, you will want to lock all of your categories and attributes before running a query.

      Note that leaving even a small number of categories and attributes unlocked at the same time can result in a large number of potential
      answers to your question, which can slow down the speed of the reasoner and the Scenario Editor.

      ## Selecting From Categories
      
      When setting the value of an attribute that has a category as it's type (for example, "friend" might be an attribute
      of a person, and also refer to other persons), the interface will allow you to choose from the objects that already
      exist in the target category. To refer to an object, it must be included in the category first. So for example,
      if you want to say that jason and june are friends, you must first create both jason and june in the category "person",
      and then in the "friend" attribute of june, add jason as a value.

      ## Duplicate Values

      The Scenario Editor will allow you to add as many values as you like to an attribute, including duplicate values.
      However, duplicate values do not have any meaning to the Blawx reasoner. It treats your fact scenario as if each
      value occurred only once.

      Note also that if you re-enter an object or value that was already provided by the code or your
      test, it will appear in the list as normal, but it will be locked, and you will not be able to delete it.

      ## True / False Values (You Usually Only Need One)

      Because a true / false attribute can only hold two values, and duplicates of those values are meaningless, there
      is never a reason to add more than two values to a true / false attribute for an object. The Scenario Editor will
      let you add as many boolean values as you like, but no more than two can possibly be meaningful.

      There are very few circumstances in which setting an objects true /false attribute to both true and false
      will be meaningful. In most cases, the attribute models a thing that can only be true, false, or unknown about an
      object. So it might seem unnecessary to allow the user to apply more than one.

      However, while there are very few circumstances, there are more than zero, so you need to be careful you are not
      inadvertently adding multiple true / false values unintentionally.
