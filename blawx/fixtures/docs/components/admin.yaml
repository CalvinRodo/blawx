      # Blawx Administration Interface

      The Blawx Administration Interface is available by navigating to `/admin` on your
      Blawx Server.

      ## User Accounts

      The primary purpose of accessing the admin interface is currently to be able to create
      user accounts. This can be done by logging into the admin interface using an
      admin username and password, click on users on the left side of the screen, and clicking
      "add user" on the top right of the users screen.

      Once you have created an account here, it will be possible for users to log in using that
      account in the main Blawx Interface.

      Note that Blawx' user permissions currently require that the user be logged in to be able
      to access anything other than the main page, the login screen, or the documentation. However,
      all users have access to all functions of the server.

      More fine-grained user control will be implemented in future versions.

      By default, on a new installation of Blawx, there is an admin account created with the user
      name `admin` and the password `blawx2022`. When installing a server to which you want to
      restrict access, make sure to change the admin password immediately.

      Servers will also be created with a demo account with the username `demo` and the password
      `blawx2022`. This user account should be deleted in the admin interface if you are trying
      to restrict access to your server. The demo account is capable of doing anything inside
      the system except add and remove users and access the admin interface.
