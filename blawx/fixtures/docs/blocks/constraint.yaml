      # Constraint Block

      ![Constraint Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/constraint.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The constraint block is found in the Primary drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The constraint block is used to set out a combination of statements that cannot
      all be true at the same time.

      ## Technical Details

      The constraint block is an outer block. It accepts a single stack of statements, which is valid if it
      includes at least one statement.

      A constraint is used to express a set of facts that cannot all be true at the same
      time in any of the models returned by any question block.

      For example, you might use a constraint block to indicate that a person cannot
      be both the testator of a will and the trustee named in the will at the same time.

      ## Tips

      Using the constraint block can cause your code to run more slowly.
