      # Math Operator Block

      ![Math Operator Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/math_operator.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The math operator block is found in the Number section of the Data Statements
      drawer in the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The math operator block is used to perform a mathematical operation to two
      numerical values.

      ## Technical Details

      The mathematical operator block can only be used inside a calculation block.

      It returns a number. It accepts two internal inputs both of which must be 
      variables or numbers, or blocks that return a number, like another math operator block.

      It performs the operation selected in the drop-down, either addition, subtraction,
      multiplication, or division.

      Normal mathematical order of operations does not apply. Each input to a math operator
      block is treated as if it was surrounded by parentheses.  So `(2 * (3 + 4))` will always
      be evaluated to 14.

      ## Tips

      Some complicated calculations can require nesting multiple math operator blocks inside
      one another. If your calculation is becoming difficult to visually read, you can
      break it into steps by using multiple calculation blocks, and re-using variables between them.
