      # Numerical Constraint Block

      ![Numerical Constraint Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/numerical_constraint.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The numerical constraint block is found in the Number section of the
      Data Statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The numerical constraint block is used to specify that a numerical value must be
      in a given range.

      ## Technical Details

      The numerical constraint block is a statement, and can be stacked with other statements.

      It requires two internal connectors, both of which must be variables or numbers.

      It allows the user to choose the restriction to be applied to the left input, relative
      to the right input, either "less than", "greater than", "less than or the same value as",
      or "greater than or the same value as".

      ## Tips

      The numerical constraint block is a very powerful tool when dealing with numbers that
      are constrainted to be greater, equal to, or less than other numbers.

      If a person at least 16 must pay taxes, and a person at least 18 may vote, then we know
      the age of a person who is required to pay taxes and cannot vote is at least 16 and less
      than 18. That is a numerical constraint that can be calculated by combining two other
      numerical constraints.

      Through the numerical constrain block, Blawx allows you to express those sorts of rules, and get answers
      that are expressed as a range like "16 >= Age < 18".
