      # Calculation Block

      ![Calculation Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/calculation.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The calculation block is located in the Number section of the 
      Data Statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The calculation block is used to provide a mathematical calculation of a numerical value.

      ## Technical Details

      The calculation block is a statement block, and can be stacked with other statement blocks.
      It always evaluates to true.

      The calculation block has two internal connectors. The first requires a variable to which
      the result of the calculation will be assigned. The second requires a block that returns
      a number, which might include either a number value, or a math operation.

      ## Tips

      Any time that you want to perform a mathematical operation, it needs to be surrounded by
      a calculation block.

      Calculation blocks are similar to variable assignment blocks, except that the value assigned
      is always a number. If you want to assign a specific number value to a variable, and not
      the result of a calculation, you can use the variable assignment block instead. Also,
      if you want to assign the value of one variable that is bound to a number to another variable,
      you must use the variable assignment block, and not the calculation block.
