      # Question Block

      ![Question Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/question.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The question block is found in the Primary drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The question block is used to send a question to the Blawx reasoner, and
      get one or more answers based on the code provided.

      In most programming languages, all of the code that you write tells the
      computer what to "do". In Blawx, that's not true. Most of the code tells
      the computer what it "knows," and only question blocks ask the computer
      to do anything.

      So if you have code, but no question block, when you click "Run", nothing
      much will happen!

      ## Technical Details

      The question block is an outer block, and accepts a single stack of statements, which is valid if
      it is a stack of at least one statement.  The stack is treated as if all
      of its parts were joined together with "and".  All of the statements must
      be true at the same time for an answer to be included. Variables in the
      stack share a single scope, so anywhere you are using the same variable name
      you are referring to the same object.

      (Remember that the opposite is not true. If you use different variable names,
      that does not necessarily mean you are referring to different objects. To
      ensure that you include results only where two variables do not refer to the
      same object, use the object disequality block.)

      The question block will return a number of models, where each model represents
      a combination of an answer to the question, and a way of obtaining that answer.
      If there are two possible answers, and three ways of obtaining each answer, you
      will get six models.

      While it is possible to have more than one question block in a workspace, only
      the last active question block will actually be used by the software.

      ## Tips

      If your question block returns the answer "no models found", but you think that it should
      be finding answers, here are a few good troubleshooting tricks:

      1. Try removing statements from the question block until you get an answer, and
         then adding them back in until you find which statement is failing.
      2. Try removing variables from the question block and replacing them with object
         selectors that you think should have been returned.
      3. Try using assumption blocks to see if adding or removing assumptions from your
         code changes the result.
      4. If your query is a single statement, try surrounding it with a not block, to
         see if Blawx can explain why no answer was found.
