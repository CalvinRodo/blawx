      # Date Add Block

      ![Date Add Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/date_add.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Date Add block is located in the data statments drawer of the Blawx toolbox,
      in the Date sub-drawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Date Add block is used to calculate a new date value by adding a duration to
      an existing date value.

      ## Technical Details

      The Date Add block is a statement block that can be stacked with other statements.

      It accepts three inputs: a duration value, and two date values.

      If the first variable is bound to a duration, and the second value is bound to a
      date, the third variable will be bound to the date obtained by adding the duration
      to the first date.  If all three are bound, it will check whether the relationship
      holds.

      To subtract a duration from a date, use a negative sign in the duration.
