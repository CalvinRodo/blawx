      # Duration Between Block

      ![Duration Between Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/duration_between.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Duration Between block is located in the data statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox,
      in the date sub-drawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Duration Between block is used to calculate the duration between two date values.

      ## Technical Details

      The Duration Between block is a statement block that can be stacked with other statement blocks.

      It accepts three inputs. The first two must be dates or variables. The third must be a duration
      or a variable.  If the first two inputs are bound to date values, the third will be bound to
      a duration that indicates the time that has passed between the two dates.

      ## Tips

      Note that for the time being, the duration between block generates durations that have only
      a day value, and a sign. The year and month are always zero.  This is behaviour that is anticipated
      to change in future versions of Blawx.

      The use of durations including year and month values is not recommended, as they tend to behave
      in unpredictable ways, given that months and years are not of a consistent duration.
