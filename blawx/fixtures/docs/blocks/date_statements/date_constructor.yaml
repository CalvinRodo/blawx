      # Date Constructor Block

      ![Date Constructor Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/date_constructor.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Date Constructor block is located in the data statements drawer of the Blawx toolbox,
      in the date sub-drawer.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Date Constructor block is used to generate a date value dynamically.

      ## Technical Details

      The date constructor block is a value block that returns a value of type date.  It can be
      used anywhere that a date value block can be used.

      It accepts three inputs, each of which must be a number or a variable.

      ## Tips

      While the date value block will prevent you from entering invalid months (like 13)
      and invalid days (like 40), the date constructor block cannot. If you are using
      number value blocks in all three inputs of the date constructor block (you are not using
      any variables), it is a better practice to use the date value block instead.
