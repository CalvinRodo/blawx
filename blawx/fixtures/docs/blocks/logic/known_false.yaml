      # Known False Block

      ![Known False Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/known_false.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The known false block is located in the Logic drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The known false block is used to specify that the statement it contains is known
      with certainty to be false.

      ## Technical Details

      The known false block is a statement that can be stacked with other statements.

      The known false block accepts has an internal statement connection which must be a single statement.

      The known false block is one of two forms of negation in Blawx. The other is the not block.

      The not block and the known false block differ in that the known false block asserts that
      something is false, while the not block asserts that it is either false, or the truth
      of the statement is not known.

      ## Tips

      The known false block is not usually going to be used in rules, and is more common to use in facts.

      If you are not sure which negation block to use, start with "not."
      
      One way to think of the difference between "known false" and "not" is by looking at the difference
      between "not guilty" and "innocent" in criminal law.

      Courts don't typically find accused "innocent", because that would be to say that they know, as
      a fact, that it is not true that the party is guilty. They typically find people "not guilty", which
      means they may or may not be guilty, but there was not enough evidence to prove it.

      If "guilty" was an attribute in Blawx, "not guilty" would be wrapping the "guilty" attribute In
      a "not" block, and "innocent" would be wrapping guilty in a "known false" block.
