      # Comparison Block

      ![Comparison Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/comparison.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The comparison block is located in the Logic drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The comparison block is used to determine the relative order of two values.

      ## Technical Details

      The comparison block accepts two variables, or two values of the same type,
      which are ordered. It also requires you
      to select a comparison between them, one of:
      * the same value as
      * a different value than
      * less than
      * greater than
      * less than or the same value as
      * greater than or the same value as

      The comparison returns true if the comparison between the two values is true.

      ## Tips

      Note that a comparison between two values is different from a numerical constraint,
      because a comparison requires that the values being compared be known specifically.

      If the value of a variable X is not known, the numerical constraint X > 10 will result
      in an answer of "X > 10". A comparison of `X > 10` while X is unknown will result in
      "no models", because an unknown amount is not larger than 10.

      Note also that a comparison between two values is different from a test of equivalence.
      If you want to know whether or not two variables have the same value, you can use
      the "is the same value as" comparison. If you want to know whether or not two variables
      refer to the same object, you need to use the object equivalence block.
