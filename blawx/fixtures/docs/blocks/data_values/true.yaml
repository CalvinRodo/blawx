      # True Value Block

      ![True Value Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/true_value.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The true value block is located in the Data Values drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The true value block is used to indicate that the value of a true / false attribute is true.

      ## Technical Details

      The true value block is a boolean value, and can be placed only in locations that
      are expecting a boolean value. That is typically limited to the value input of
      an attribute selector block, where the attribute is using the "True / False" data type.
