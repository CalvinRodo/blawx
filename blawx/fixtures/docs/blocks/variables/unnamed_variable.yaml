      # Unnamed Variable Block

      ![Unnamed Variable Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/unnamed_variable.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The unnamed variable block is located in the Variables drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The unnamed variable block is used when you need a variable, but you do not need to
      use the variable more than once in the same scope, and you don't care what object
      was bound to that variable.

      For instance, you might have a rule that makes conclusions about an attribute called "has_a_sibling".
      In that rule, you might use an attribute called "sibling_of" to check to see if someone has
      a relationship to at least one sibling, but you don't care who the sibling is. In that
      case you might write a condition using the unnamed variable, which reads "(Person) is
      the sibling of (any)".

      ## Technical Details

      The unnamed variable block accepts no inputs, and has no fields.

      It can be used anywhere an object or a value is expected.

      ## Tips

      It's a good idea to start with named variables, and switch to unnamed variables only when you
      are sure your rules are working as anticipated.

      The Blawx reasoner will warn you if you have a rule in which a variable name is used only once.
      Those are places where the unnamed variable may be appropriate, or where you may have accidentally
      misspelled a variable name. If you start with too many unnamed variables, Blawx cannot warn you
      that you might have made a mistake.
