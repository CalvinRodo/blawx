      # Variable Assignment Block

      ![Variable Assignment Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/variable_assignment.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The variable assignment block is found in the Variables drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The variable assignment block is used to assign an object or value to a variable.
      
      ## Technical Details

      The variable assignment block is a statement, and can be stacked with other statements.
      In the conditions of rules, in a constraint, and in a question block, it is always true, and simply changes
      the value of a variable in that scope.

      Its first internal connector expects a variable. Its second internal connector expects
      either a variable, an object, or a value.

      It should not be used in facts, or in the conclusions of rules.

      ## Tips

      The variable assignment block is used to assign a value to a variable explicitly. This
      can be useful in situations where, for example, you would like to re-run a question where
      the same value is being used over and over, and needs to be changed. Using the
      variable assignment block would allow you to assign the variable once, and then re-use
      it by referring to the same variable name repeatedly.
