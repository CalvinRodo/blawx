      ![Category Equivalence Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/category_equivalence.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The category equivalence block is located in the Categories drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The category equivalence block is used to indicate that all members of one category are
      also members of another category.

      ## Technical Details

      The category equivalence block is a statement, and can be stacked with other statements.
      It accepts two inputs, both of which must be categories. The effect of the category
      equivalence block is that all members of the first category are members of the second
      category.

      ## Tips

      A category equivalence block is a short-form of a rule that states "when we know
      X is in category A, we also know X is in category B".

      Category equivalence happens in one direction only. If you want to say
      something like "all tolkien books are great books, and all great books are tolkien books",
      you will need two category equivalence blocks.
