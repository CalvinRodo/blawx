      ![New Attribute Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/new_attribute.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The new attribute block is located in the Categories drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The new attribute block is used to add an attribute to a category.

      ## Technical Details

      The new attribute block must be placed inside a category attribute block, and applies
      to the category named in the category attribute block. It requires an attribute name,
      which must begin with a lowercase letter and not include spaces. It also requires a
      data type, which must be one of the datatype blocks in the Data Types drawer of the Blawx
      toolbox, or a category.

      ## Tips

      Note that if you specify a data type, and not a category, your attribute selector blocks
      for that attribute will only accept the right type of value, and variables. If you choose
      a category as the data type, your attribute selector blocks will accept any object, or variables.

      Attribute names should be unique, even as between different categories.
