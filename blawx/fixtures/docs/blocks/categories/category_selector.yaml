      ## Where Is It?

      The category selector block is located in the Known Categories drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The category selector block is used to specify a category.

      ## Technical Details

      The category block can be placed only on inputs that
      are expecting a category,
      such as in a category attribute block,
      a category equivalence block, an object category block, or a new attribute block.
