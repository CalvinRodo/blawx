      # Category Display Block

      ![Category Display Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/category_display.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The category display block is located in the Categories drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The category display block is used to change how categories are described in new object
      blocks and in explanations.

      ## Technical Details

      The category display block is a custom block type that can only be placed immediately
      below a new category block.  It applies only to the new category block it is immediately
      below.

      The category display block accepts 2 inputs, the text that should appear the object name,
      and the text that should appear after the object name when referring to a member of that
      category.

      For example, if you have a category named "person", the default new object block will read
      "(object name) is a person". However, using the category display block, you could change
      this text to read "we know (object name) is human". To do this "we know" would be placed
      in the first text field, and "is human" would be placed in the second text field.

      The revised display for the category will be used in new object blocks, and in explanations.

      ## Tips

      It is possible to change the way that a category is displayed in such a way as to leave out
      the name of the category. In the example above, the word "person" is still the name of the
      category, but it no longer appears in the new object blocks or in the explanations. This can
      make things easier for people using your code, but it can also make your code harder to
      maintain, because it is more difficult to determine what category is being changed.
