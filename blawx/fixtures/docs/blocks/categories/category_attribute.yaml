      ![Category Attribute Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/category_attributes.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The category attribute block is located in the Categories drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The category attribute block is used to create new attributes associated with a category.

      ## Technical Details

      The category attribute block accepts one internal input, which must be a category selector.
      It also has an external connector which must be a stack of new attribute blocks, optionally
      with attribute display blocks included.

      ## Tips

      Multiple category attribute blocks can be created for the same category, so it is possible
      to add attributes to a category in multiple places in your code.
