      # JSON Input Block

      ![JSON Input Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/json_input.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The JSON input block is found in the Primary drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The JSON input block is used to simulate an input request that might be
      sent to an API endpoint when running your code.

      ## Technical Details

      The JSON input block is an outer block.

      The JSON input block accepts a single multi-line text field (you can hit
      `enter` on your keyboard to start a new line of text). To be valid the contents
      of the JSON input block's text field should be valid JSON in a schema
      understood by the Blawx API.

      There should be a maximum of one JSON input block per workspace.


      ### Data Schema for Interview, Run Endpoints

      The data schema expected by the JSON block is as follows:
      The main JSON object is a dictionary, the keys of which are the names of categories in your code.
      The values of those dictionary entries are themselves a dictionary with the keys
      "members_known", "attributes_known", and "members".  `members_known` is either `true` or `false`,
      and indicates if the list is known to be complete. If it is not, the interview endpoint will
      cause Blawx to assume that the category might include additional objects.
      "attributes_known" is a dictionary where the keys are the names of attributes, and the values
      are either `true` or `false`. If the value is `false` the interview endpoint will
      generate assumption statements for additional values for that attribute and any object.
      "members" is a dictionary, where the keys are the names of objects in that category. The value
      of an entry in members is a dictionary with keys representing the name of an attribute applicable
      to that category. The values of those entries are a dictionary with keys "values_known", and "values". "values_known"
      is `true` if there are no other possible values for that attribute in that object, and `false` otherwise.
      The interview endpoint will generate partially-ground assumptions for additional values for that object
      if the value is `false`. "values" is a list of the values that are known for that attribute and object.

      "members_known" and "attributes_known" and "values_known" entries are ignored by the Run endpoint, which
      is the only endpoint available from inside the Test Editor.

      ## Tips

      Often, it can be easier to use the API endpoint itself, and type JSON directly into the web form available
      there. The JSON block also provides no validation of your JSON. The error messages displayed due to mal-formed
      JSON in the API endpoint pages are more helpful. The JSON block should therefore be used primarily just to
      demonstrate a query run with known facts and no abducibility.

      The JSON block is likely to be deprecated in future versions of Blawx.
