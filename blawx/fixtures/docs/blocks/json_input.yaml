      # JSON Input Block

      ![JSON Input Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/json_input.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The JSON input block is found in the Primary drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The JSON input block is used to simulate an input request that might be
      sent to an API endpoint when running your code.

      ## Technical Details

      The JSON input block is an outer block.

      The JSON input block accepts a single multi-line text field (you can hit
      `enter` on your keyboard to start a new line of text). To be valid the contents
      of the JSON input block's text field should be valid JSON in a schema
      understood by the Blawx API.

      There should be a maximum of one JSON input block per workspace.

      Currently, the JSON input block uses an s(CASP)-specific format, not a Blawx-specific
      format. The keys of the payload object are translated into predicates. The value of
      each is a list of lists of parameters. Each outer list is converted into a single fact
      statement, and each inner list is used as the list of parameters in that fact statement.

      To generate the scasp statement `this(is,complicated).` you would use the following
      JSON:
      ```json
      {
        "this": [
          [
            "is", "complicated"
          ]
        ]
      }
      ```
