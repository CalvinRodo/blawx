      # JSON Input Block

      ![JSON Input Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/json_input.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The JSON input block is found in the Primary drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The JSON input block is used to simulate an input request that might be
      sent to an API endpoint when running your code.

      ## Technical Details

      The JSON input block is an outer block.

      The JSON input block accepts a single multi-line text field (you can hit
      `enter` on your keyboard to start a new line of text). To be valid the contents
      of the JSON input block's text field should be valid JSON in a schema
      understood by the Blawx API.

      There should be a maximum of one JSON input block per workspace.
