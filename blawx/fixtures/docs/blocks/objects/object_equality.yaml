      # Object Equality Block

      ![Object Equality Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/object_equality.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The object equality block is located in the Objects drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The object equality block is used to assert that two objects are references to
      the same real-world concept.

      ## Technical Details

      The object equality block is a statement, and can be stacked with other statements.

      It accepts two internal inputs. Both inputs are expected to be objects, or variables.

      It can be used in conditions of rules and constraints, and in questions, but in most
      cases you will want to just re-use the same variable name, which will have the same
      effect.

      ## Tips

      The object equality block is used relatively rarely. You are most likely to need it
      if you are combining inputs from more than one source, and you want to specify that
      an object that was received from one source is identical to an object received from
      another. For example, you might have a ruleset for determining the winner of a game
      of Rock, Paper, Scissors, and you might import data from a system that plays the
      game "Boulder, Parchment, Shears". In that case, it would make sense to say "the
      parchment object is the same thing as the paper object", etc.

      Note that saying that two objects are the same thing is different from asserting that
      to variables hold the same value. To check to see whether or not two different values
      are equal, use the comparison block.
