      ![Opposes Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/opposes.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Opposes block is located in the exceptions drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Opposes block is used to specify that two conclusions oppose one another,
      and if both are found one may overrule the other.

      ## Technical Details

      ## Tips

      If you have a true/false attribute, it is not necessary to use the opposes block
      for Blawx to understand that a "true" value and a "false" value for that attribute for
      the same object are opposing statements.
