      ## Where Is It?

      The Holds block is located in the exceptions drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Holds block is used to query whether a conclusion was reached according to
      any section of the rules, and that conclusion was not overruled.

      ## Technical Details

      The Holds block is a statement block which can be stacked with other statements. It accepts
      an internal statement stack, which should be a single statement block, which is the conclusion
      that is being sought.

      ## Tips

      Even if you are not using exceptions, the combination of "According To" and Holds blocks
      can be used to insert information about the source of your rules into your natural
      language explanations.
