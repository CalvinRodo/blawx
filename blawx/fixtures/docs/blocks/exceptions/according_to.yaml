      ![According To Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/according_to.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The According To block is located in the exceptions drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The According To block is used to state that (or query whether) a given conclusion
      was reached by a given section of the rules. This is used in order to allow the
      user to specify how to deal with defaults and exceptions, and do allow the user
      to see how individual sections of a law would have treated a fact scenario if not
      for other sections that overrruled them.
