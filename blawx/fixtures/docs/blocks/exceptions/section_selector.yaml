      ## Where Is It?

      The Section Selector block is located in the known sections drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Section Selector block is used to refer to a specific section of your rules. It is
      used in According To blocks, to indicate which section reaches the conclusion, and
      in Overrules blocks, to indicate which section overrules which other section.

      ## Technical Details

      The Section Selector block is a value block that provides a reference to a section in
      the current rule.  It is used in According To blocks, and Overrules Blocks.

      ## Tips

      Section selector blocks will be given a name that is the abbreviation of the title in
      your rule text, followed by an abbreviation of the section's specific location in the
      rule. If you are using spans, it can be helpful to use short span names so as to
      avoid the location references from getting too long to be displayed in the block.

      Because the abbreviation used in the section selector block is based on the first
      character of the title provided in your legal text, it is advisable not to use punctuation
      and numerals at the start of words in the title of your legal text, to ensure that the section
      selectors are readable. For example, if your title is "The (Very) Good Act 2004", the
      section selector for section 1 of that act will read "T(GA2 1".
