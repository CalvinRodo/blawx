      ![Overrules Block](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/overrules.png)

      ## Where Is It?

      The Overrules block is located in the exceptions drawer of the Blawx toolbox.

      ## What Does It Do?

      The Overrules block is used to specify that conclusions reached by one section of law
      overrule the conclusions reached by another section of law, when those conclusions
      are opposed.

      ## Technical Details

      The Overrules block is a statement block, and can be stacked with other statement blocks.
      It accepts to interal connectors, both of which are expecting a variable (only the "any")
      variable would apply, or a statement selector. The order of the statement selectors is
      significant. The first section named is superior, the second section named is inferior.

      ## Tips

      For complicated exception relationships, it can be helpful to make an overrules statement
      conditional on certain other things being true. This can be accomplished by using the
      overrules statement as the conclusion of a rule.
