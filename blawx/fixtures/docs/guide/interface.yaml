      # The Blawx Code Editor Interface

      This page is designed to give you a tour of the Blawx Code Editor, which is
      the interface in which encodings of legal text and tests are developed.

      ## Main Elements

      The main elements of the Code Editor interface are the button bar at the top,
      the navigation pane on the left, the coding workspace in the middle, and the
      output pane on the right.

      The button bar, navigation pane, and output pane are straightforward.

      ### Button Bar
      The Code Editor button bar consists of four buttons:
      * Clear - This will delete all code from your coding workspace
      * Help - This will open the Blawx Documentation
      * Save - This will save the currently selected section's code to the Blawx server
      * Exit - This will return you to the Rule screen for the current Rule.

      If you are using the Test interface, there are three additional buttons:
      * Run - Runs the test in the test interface, opens up the output pane and displays the
        results.
      * Bot - Starts BlawxBot using the current test.
      * Delete - Deletes the current test from the Rule, and returns you to the Rule screen.
      
      ### Navigation Pane
      The navigation pane appears on the left of the screen, and can be hidden and revealed
      by clicking on its right border. It gives you a collapsing nested tree view of the
      rules you are encoding, and allows you to select the section that you want to encode.
      When you choose a section selector, the code for that selection, if any, is displayed
      in the coding workspace.

      In the Test Editor, there is no navigation pane.

      ### Output Pane
      The output pane appears on the right of the screen, and can be hidden and revealed by
      clicking on its left border. In the Code Editor, it only shows the s(CASP) code generated by
      Blawx for the current section of the rule.

      In the Test Editor, the output pane has two additional tabs. The "Output" tab shows answers
      to questions when the test is run, and will be displayed automatically when you click "Run".
      The "Problems" tab displays raw output from the Blawx reasoner, and it primarily used for
      troubleshooting.

      ### Coding Editor

      The Blawx development editor consists of two main sections: the toolbox, and the workspace.

      #### Toolbox
      The toolbox appears on the left of the development environment, and shows a list of
      "drawers". Each drawer can be opened to show its contents, which is a set of blocks that
      can be used by dragging them into the workspace.

      Some drawers may be nested inside one another, in which case a black triangle will appear
      at the left side of the drawer name. When you click on the outer drawer, the inner drawers
      are displayed in the toolbox. When you click on an inner drawer, its contents are shown.

      All coding is done by dragging blocks from the drawers of the toolbox, and placing them
      on the workspace.

      #### Workspace
      The workspace is a canvas on which you can arrange and modify blocks in order to write
      your code.  The only other visual element in the workspace is the Trash Bin.

      ##### Trash Bin
      The trash bin is used to discard blocks that you no longer want on your workspace. This
      can be done by dragging and dropping blocks into the trash bin, by clicking the Delete
      key on the keyboard while a block is highlighted, or by deleting blocks using a context menu.

      Blocks remain in the trash bin so that if they are deleted accidentally they can be recovered.

      ##### Using the Workspace

      This section is designed to help you understand how to create, arrange, edit, and
      delete blocks inside the Code Editor workspace.

      ###### Using Blocks

      Blocks in the Code Editor can have connectors, which is how blocks are combined, and
      they can have fields, which is how a single block is configured. There are three different
      types of block fields used in Blawx: text, number, and drop-down.

      To use a block, you drag it from its drawer to the workspace, set the values in its
      fields as required, and then connect it to other blocks as required.

      ###### Vertical Connectors
      Blocks in Blawx can have vertical connectors on the top or bottom of the block.

      Blocks can also have internal vertical connectors, to which other blocks can connect.

      A block with no vertical connectors is called an "outer" block, because when you
      are writing your code, nothing should appear to be connected to its outside.

      A block with vertical connectors is called a "statement" block. Statement blocks can
      be stacked vertically, and a stack or a single block can be connected to an internal
      vertical connector.

      Usually, in Blawx, when blocks are connected vertically in a stack, that means that
      the statements are being combined with an "and". So if you stack block A on top of block B,
      together that means "A and B".

      The exceptions to this rule are attribute and category customizations, which affect only
      the block immediately above them, and fact blocks, in which the stack of statements are
      all independently true.

      All internal (negative) vertical connectors are mandatory. If you don't have something in them, you
      have done something wrong. All top vertical connectors are also mandatory. If a statement is
      not connected at the top to something else, you have done something wrong. Only bottom
      vertical connectors are not mandatory.

      ###### Input Connectors

      The other kind of connector is an input connector. This is the puzzle-piece shaped
      connector. A negative input connector is a "hole" where an input piece can be placed.
      A block with a positive input connector can be placed in those holes.

      Negative input connectors may expect certain kinds of inputs. For example, the category
      attribute block has a negative input connector that requires a category selector. If you
      try to use a block that is not a category selector, it will not "fit".

      Negative input connectors must be filled. If you don't have something connected to them,
      you have done something wrong.

      ###### Dragging Blocks With the Mouse

      If you select a block in the interface, and drag it to move it, you will move:
      
      * the block that you clicked on
      * any blocks vertically stacked below that block
      * any blocks contained in that block

      ###### Deleting Blocks

      If you delete a selected block by dragging it, you will delete all the blocks
      that were moved. If you delete a selected block by using the keyboard shortcut or
      context menu, only the selected block and any blocks it contains will be deleted.

      If you only want to delete only one block from the middle of stack, use the keyboard
      shortcuts or the context menus.

      ###### Keyboard Shortcuts

      * CTRL-C - will copy the currently selected block and any blocks it contains
      * CTRL-V - will pase the most recently copied block
      * CTRL-Z - will undo the last change to the workspace
      * CTRL-Y - will redo the last undone change to the workspace
      * Delete - will delete the currently selected block and any blocks it contains

      ###### Context Menus

      Right clicking on the workspace will give you a context menu with these options:
      
      * Undo
      * Redo
      * Clean Up Blocks - this will organize all outer blocks in a single column
      * Collapse Blocks - this will collapse all outer blocks
      * Expand Blocks - this will expand all outer blocks
      * Delete X Blocks - this will delete all the blocks in the workspace

      Right-clicking on an individual block will give you a context menu with these options:
      
      * Duplication - copies and pastes the selected block and any blocks it contains.
      * Add Comment - allows you to add a text comment to the block
      * Collapse/Expand -  minimizes the appearance of the block, or expands the block out to its normal size
      * Disable Block - marks the block as disabled. Disabled blocks are treated as though they are not in the workspace.
      * Delete X Blocks - deletes the selected block and any blocks it contains
      * Help - opens the Blawx documentation page for the current block type.
