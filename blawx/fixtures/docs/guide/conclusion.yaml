      # Conclusion

      That's it! Hopefully this Beginner's Guide has given you an idea of what Blawx is,
      how it is used, and why it might be useful in Rules as Code.

      * Step 1 - put your legislative text into Blawx using a simple plain-text format
      * Step 2 - encode your rules - as rules - in a user-friendly tool, in a structure that mirrors the law
      * Step 3 - Use sophisticated reasoning capabilities to ensure your code - and your law - behaves as intended
      * Step 4 - Generate explainable, legally compliant apps at the touch of a button

      about each of the blocks used in the interface.

      This guide was updated in September of 2022 to be up to date with version 1.3.29-alpha of Blawx.
