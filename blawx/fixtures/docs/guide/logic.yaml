      # Logic Blocks

      This page describes the basic logic blocks available
      in the Logic drawer of the Toolbox.

      ## Negation

      Blawx provides
      you with two different types of negation.

      The first type of negation
      is a "known false” block. It looks like this:

      ![not]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/img/not.png)

      The second type of negation is a "not" block. It looks
      like this:

      ![naf not]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/naf_not.png)

      It is
      very important to understand the difference between them.

      Inside a Fact
      or a Rule Conclusion, a "known false" block tells Blawx that the included
      statement is known with certainty to be false. Inside a Question or a Rule Condition,
      it asks Blawx to check to see whether it is known with certainty that the statement
      is false.

      A "not" block does require that a thing is certainly false,
      but if it is known false, the "not" block will succeed. But a "not" block
      will also succeed if there is only no facts or rules that can be used to derive
      that the statement is true.

      "Not" blocks can't be used in facts, or
      the conclusions of rules. They are used in queries, and in the conditions of
      rules.

      Let's imagine you want to ask if there are no dogs. You might
      (incorrectly) write this code:

      ![wrong not any dogs]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/img/wrong_not_any_dogs.png)

      But this code will not work as expected.
      A "known false" only returns “true” if its contents are explicitly 
      stated
      to be false. But if a fact stated (or a rule concluded) "it is known false
      that any is in the category Dog", that would mean “it is impossible for an
      object to be a dog.” That is probably not what you meant to check for.

      You
      don't want to know if that statement is explicitly false. You want to know
      whether
      you can find a specific example in which it is true. Put another way,
      you
      don't want to ask "is it true that nothing can be a dog?", you want to ask

      "do you know of any examples of dogs?" So the "not" version
      is what
      you need.

      ![correct not any dogs]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/correct_not_any_dogs.png)

      That
      version of the rule will work as expected.

      Another way to think about
      the difference is to think of statements as having opposites.
      "Known false"
      checks to see if the opposite is true. "Not" checks to see if the opposite
      is
      true, *or* if the statement can't be proven.

      In law, we are familiar
      with this distinction between the two different kinds of negation. In criminal
      trials, when a court decides that a person is "not guilty", they are using
      the "not". "Not guilty" means *either* the person is innocent (the opposite
      of guilty), *or* there was not sufficient proof to
      find them guilty.

      As
      a general rule, you usually want to use "not" in questions and in rule
      conditions.
      "Known fasle" is the only thing that will work in rule conclusions and facts.


      ## Comparison

      ![comparison]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/comparitor.png)

      The
      comparison operator has 6 different comparisons it can make between two values,
      or objects.

      They are quite self-explanatory. The block will succeed if
      the two values provided satisfy the condition, which is one of:

      * "is
      the same value as"
      * "is a different value from"
      * "is less than"
      *
      "is greater than"
      * "is less than or the same value as"
      * "is greater
      than or the same value as"

      There are a couple of things to note. First,
      it will only work if the values are ordered, like numbers, or dates. Second,
      it compares the values, but it does not know whether the values are coming from
      the
      same source.

      If you want to know whether objects referred to by
      two variables are the same object (they are "identical"), then you don't want
      to compare their values, you want to check their identities. That is done using
      the object equivalence or object disequivalence blocks.
