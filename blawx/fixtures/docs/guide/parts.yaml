      # Parts of Blawx

      Blawx is divided into Rules, Sections, and Tests.
      
      ## Rules

      A Rule in Blawx is a container for a rule text, the encoding of that rule text,
      and any tests that use that encoding. The Rule is given a name and a rule text
      when created, and they can be changed in the Rule Editor.

      ## Sections

      Blawx reads the rule text to find all of the sections that are defined in that
      text. Each section in the text of the rule has a corresponding encoding in Blawx.
      Encodings for each section are created in the Code Editor for that Rule.

      ## Tests

      A test has a name, and an encoding.
      The encoding of a test is used to specify facts, and pose a question.
      Where the encoding of the sections allows you to say what the rule means, it is the encoding
      of a test that allows you to say you what you want to do with that rule.

      ### Running Tests
      You can click "Run" in the test code editor
      to see the answer to the question, if any. Running tests can be used for making sure that
      your code is behaving as expected. It is also one way of "using" the code to find
      answers to new questions.

      ### BlawxBot
      You can also click "Bot" in the test code editor, to convert your test into a
      chatbot. Tests used for BlawxBot sometimes have only a question, and no facts.

      ### Web API
      Everything that you can do with a Test in the Blawx interface can also be done
      automatically in any other interface. All of the features of a test are available as a Web API.
