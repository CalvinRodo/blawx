      # Variables

      Variables are a fundamental part of how Blawx works.
      You can't do anything interesting without them. But if you have experience
      with
      other programming languages, they probably will not behave as you first expect.

      Don't
      worry, variables in Blawx are VERY easy to understand.

      ## Understanding Variables in Blawx

      Imagine I asked you "this species is carnivourous,
      it is four-legged, and it is known as man's best
      friend, what is it?" What would you
      answer?

      A dog!

      I gave you a list
      of things that was true. The list was:

      * it is a species, and
      * it is carnivorous, and
      * it is four-legged, and
      * it is known as man's best friend

      I asked you to think of a specific thing that "it" might be.
      Or put differently,
      I asked you to think of a specific thing, where if you
      put that thing everywhere the word "it"
      appears, the four statements would
      all be true.

      **The way we are using "it" in that list is *exactly* how
      a Blawx variable works.**

      See? Easy!

      A Blawx variable is just
      a name that you give to an unknown. When you use the same name in the same
      scope, it refers
      to the same unknown.

      This is also precisely the way variables are used
      in math.

      It is very different from how they are used in most programming
      languages, where a variable tends to be a name for a piece of 
      memory where information is stored.

      If you are not a programmer, but you have done calculus, variables in Blawx
      should be pretty easy to understand.  Sorry, programmers!

      ## Variables In Action

      ### Single Variable

      The
      first and most obvious place that you will use variables is in questions. The
      dog question above could be posed in Blawx like this:

      ![it query]({{
      site.baseurl }}/img/it_query.png)

      This example uses the word "It" as
      the name of the variable, but you can use any other word you like.

      **Note that
      variable names should not include spaces, and must start with a capital letter.**

      ### Variables in Rule Conclusions

      Do not use a variable in a rule conclusion
      that wasn't also used in the conditions of that rule. Otherwise, your variable
      will match with everything in the database, which probably isn't what you wanted.

      ### Copy, Don't Type

      Because variables are names that you type, and not declared
      like objects or categories, there is a higher risk of typos. It is a good practice
      to copy and paste variable blocks whenever possible to avoid typos.

      See the Code Editor Interface Guide for details on copying and pasting code.

      ### Multiple Variables

      Where Blawx gets very powerful is in its ability to
      match multiple variables at the same time.

      For example, let's take this
      rule that defines the winner of a game of rock-paper-scissors:

      ![rock
      paper scissors]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rps_winner.png)

      This rule uses
      5 variables in the conditions, and only 2 of them in the conclusion.

      Blawx
      searches for a set of 5 data points that can fill in for the variables "game",
      "player", "other_player", "player_throw", and "other_player_throw",
      which will make all of those 10 statements in the condition true.

      The
      more complicated your data structure, and the more layers of that data structure
      you need to navigate in order to reach a conclusion, the more variables you
      will need in your rules and queries.

      ### Sameness and Differentness

      Blawx
      is going to automatically find data that can be put in the place of the variable
      everywhere it appears. So it checks to see if
      the data is the same in each
      place the same variable is used.

      You might assume that Blawx also checks
      to see if a *different* piece of data is used
      everywhere that *different*
      variables are used, but **this is not true**.

      Let's imagine we have the
      following ontology:

      ![family ontology]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/family_ontology.png)

      And
      let's say that we have the following rule in order to calculate siblings:

      ![sibling
      broken]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/sibling_rule_broken.png)

      This will incorrectly
      tell us that Wednesday is her own sibling. Why?

      Because Blawx will see
      if there are values that it can put into A, B, and C, using the same values
      each time each variable is used, and have all of the statements in the condition
      be true.

      So here, if A is Wednesday, and if B is Wednesday, and if C
      is Morticia, all three statements are true.

      Therefore Wednesday (A) has
      a sibling Wednesday (B).

      Blawx is checking to see that the A in the condition
      is the same as the A in the conclusion, the B in the condition is the same as
      in the conclusion, and the C is the same both times it appears in the condition.
      But is not checking to see if anything is different.

      To force a check for difference, you have to be explicit, like this:

      ![sibling fixed]({{
      site.baseurl }}/img/sibling_rule_fixed.png)

      Now Wednesday has only one
      sibling, Pugsley, and Pugsley has only one sibling, Wednesday.

      ## Types of Variables

      Blawx gives you two different types of variables that you
      can use:

      ### Named Variables

      ![variable]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/variable_selector.png)

      A
      normal variable is just a name. Blawx will look for data which, if you put it
      in everywhere the 
      variable appears, it makes the statement true. And if
      you used it in a question, it will tell you what that data was.

      In fact,
      this is the only kind of variable that will cause Blawx to give you the specifics
      in response to a question.

      A variable should start with a capital letter,
      and have no spaces.

      ### Unnamed Variables

      ![unnamed]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/img/unnamed_variable.png)

      If you need to check that *something* can
      be put into a statement, but you don't need to learn what,
      and you won't
      ever need Blawx to make sure it's the same *something* that was used elsewhere,
      you can use
      the unnamed variable block.

      Using an unnamed variable
      is the same as using a named variable only one time in a question or rule condition,
      except that Blawx will warn you about using a variable only once, but it will
      not warn you if the variable is unnamed.

      ## Variable Scope

      Two
      variables with the same name refer to the same thing if both uses of the variable are in the
      same rule or question. Variables in different rules or questions can reuse the
      same names, and it has no effect. This is called the variable "scope".
