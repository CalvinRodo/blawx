      # Beginners Guide to Blawx

      Welcome to Blawx!

      ## What is Blawx?

      Blawx is a web-based, user-friendly tool for Rules as Code. It
      is free, open
      source software provided under the MIT license by Jason Morris.

      ## Experimental Prototype
      Blawx is an experimental prototype, designed for use in Rules as Code
      experiments, and as a teaching tool. It is not production-quality software.

      What does that mean?

      * Don't use Blawx in mission-critical applications
      * Expect design problems
      * Expect bugs
      * Expect change
      
      ## What is Rules As Code?

      Rules as Code is the idea that legislation, regulations,
      contracts, and other forms
      of formal written legal rules can and should be
      written in languages computers can understand and use.

      Some adherents
      want to translate existing laws into code to improve automation of legal services.

      Others
      want to write laws and regulations in natural languages and programming languages
      at the same time, in an interdisciplinary way, to improve legal drafting, public
      policy, and automation in public administration.

      ## Who is this guide for?

      This guide is written for people who are interested in learning
      about encoding
      legal knowledge in Blawx. It assumes no experience with programming.

      ## What does the guide include?

      This guide will take you through the four steps of using Blawx for Rules as Code:

      1. Enter Legal Text
      2. Encode Rules
      3. Test Your Code
      4. Deploy Your Code
