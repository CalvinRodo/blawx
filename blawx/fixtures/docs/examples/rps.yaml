      # Rock Paper Scissors Act

      The Rock Paper Scissors Act example included with Blawx is [available here](/2/) (assuming it hasn't been
      deleted from your system).

      It is used to demonstrate many different features of Blawx.

      A complete run-through of how to generate the Rule Paper Scissors example from scratch
      is available as [a tutorial in the Beginner's Guide](/docs/guide/rps).
