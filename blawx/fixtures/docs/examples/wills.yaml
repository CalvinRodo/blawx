      # Wills Act

      The Wills Act example included with Blawx is [available here](/9/) (assuming it hasn't been
      deleted from your system).

      It is used to demonstrate the relevance reasoning features of the interview endpoint
      for Blawx tests, as seen in BlawxBot.

      The rules set out that a person is entitled to make a will if they are over the age of 18,
      or if they are over the age of 14 and in active military service.

      The "valid_will" test in that project can be used to show that BlawxBot will not ask for
      irrelevant inputs. Click on the Bot button in that example, and you can follow these
      three scripts:

      ```
      Is there a person? yes
      What person? bob
      Does bob have an age? yes
      What age? 20
      There is an answer!
      ```
      
      One of the ways that BlawxBot determines if a question is relevant is if it is require in
      order to get an answer. Here, the rule that a person over the age of 18 is entitled to make
      a will is sufficient, so the interview stops.

      Now let's see if it asks about military service when the person's age is too low.

      ```
      Is there a person? yes
      What person? bob
      Does bob have an age? yes
      What age? 12
      Does bob have another age? no
      Is there another person?
      ```

      You will note that despite the fact it has not asked you whether bob is in the military, and
      it has not asked you whether bob is entitled to make a will, both of which questions it would
      usually include, it has concluded that no more questions about bob are relevant, and has
      moved on to the next person.

      If bob is 15, the conversation goes like this:

      ```
      Is there a person? yes
      What person? bob
      Deos bob have an age? yes
      What age? 15
      Does bob have another age? no
      Does bob have a value for military service? yes
      What value for military service? true
      There is an answer!
      ```

      Here, asking about bob's military service was relevant, and so it was asked.
