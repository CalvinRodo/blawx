      # Beard Tax Act

      The Beard Tax Act example included with Blawx is [available here](/12/) (assuming it hasn't been
      deleted from your system).

      It is an implemention inside Blawx of the Beard Tax Act rules as code demonstration task
      described at [the Better Rules github page](https://github.com/BetterRules/example-rules-as-code).

      It includes a single test designed to be run inside BlawxBot. Open the project, click on the name
      of the test, and click Bot to run the demo.
