      # Wills Act Tutorial

      All the tutorial projects are available under the New Project button.

      The Wills Act Tutorial contains a single-section rule, a single test, and no code. Instead, if you click the "Tutorial"
      button in the button bar, it will take you through a short tutorial of how to encode your rule,
      test it, and deploy it using BlawxBot.

      If you are new to Blawx, this tutorial is a good place to start.
