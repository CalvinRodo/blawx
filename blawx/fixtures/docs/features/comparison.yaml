      The Blawx documentation is a work in progress, and
      we are currently working on getting it up to speed with version 1.0.0-alpha of
      the reasoner and interface.

      The page you are seeking has not been completed
      yet. Thanks for your patience.

      ## Comparison

      ![comparison]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/comparitor.png)

      The
      comparison operator has 6 different comparisons it can make between two values,
      or objects.

      They are quite self-explanatory. The block will succeed if
      the two values provided satisfy the condition, which is one of:

      * "is
      the same value as"
      * "is a different value from"
      * "is less than"
      *
      "is greater than"
      * "is less than or the same value as"
      * "is greater
      than or the same value as"

      There are a couple of things to note. First,
      it will only work if the values are ordered, like numbers, or dates. Second,
      it compares the values, but it does not know whether the values are coming from
      the
      same source.

      If you want to know whether objects referred to by
      two variables are the same object (they are "identical"), then you don't want
      to compare their values, you want to check their identities. That is done using
      the object equivalence or object disequivalence blocks.
