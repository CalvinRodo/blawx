      # Comparison

      ![comparison](/static/blawx/docs/images/blocks/comparison.png)

      The comparison operator has 6 different comparisons it can make between two values.

      They are quite self-explanatory. The block will succeed if
      the two values provided satisfy the condition, which is one of:

      * "is the same value as"
      * "is a different value from"
      * "is less than"
      * "is greater than"
      * "is less than or the same value as"
      * "is greater than or the same value as"

      This will only work if the values are ordered, like numbers, or dates.

      It compares the values, but it does not know whether the values are coming from
      the same source.

      If you want to know whether objects referred to by
      two variables are the same object (they are "identical"), then you don't want
      to compare their values, you want to check their identities. That is done using
      the [object equality](/docs/blocks/object_equality) or [object disequality](/docs/blocks/object_disequality) blocks.

      ### Comparing Dates

      Note also that for dates, the [Date Comparison block](/docs/blocks/date_comparison) is
      also available, and uses more friendly language, like "before" and "after".

      ### Numerical Constraints
      
      A comparison serves to ask whether two values satisfy a requirement. But Blawx
      cannot use a comparison for reasoning. For example, if you say that people at least 16
      must pay taxes, and people at least 18 may vote, and you ask Blawx who must pay taxes and
      may not vote, it won't know, because it cannot logically combine the comparisons.

      For that purpose, you should use [numerical constraints](/docs/features/num_constraint).
      In that case, the "16 or older" and "less than 18" can be combined into a single answer of "people who are 16 or older,
      but less than 18".
