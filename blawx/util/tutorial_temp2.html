                <p>Now that you have encoded the vocabulary, and used that vocabulary to encode rules,
                    you can use the same vocabulary to set out a fact scenario, and ask a question about that
                    fact scenario.</p>
                <p>This can be used to see if the rules are behaving in the way expected.</p>
                <p>In this example, we will create a person, give them an age, ask if they can make a will,
                    and see what happens when we change their age.</p>

                <img src="/static/blawx/tutorials/wills/images/jane_is_12.gif" class="d-block w-100"></img>
                <p>To describe our fact scenario, that there is a person named Jane who is 12 years of age,
                    we will drag a Fact block from the Primary drawer. Then we will add a new object block from
                    the Objects drawer, and edit the field to give the new object the name "jane".</p>
                    <p>Note that the names of objects must start with lowercase letters.</p>
                    <p>To say that Jane is 12 years of age, we will drag the age attribute block from the Known
                        Attributes drawer, and add it to the fact block. In its two inputs, we will add the "jane"
                        object selector block from the known objects drawer, and a number value from the data Values
                        drawer. The number field will then be set to 12.</p>
                        <p>Click "save" at the top of the screen, and then click on the right to continue.</p>

                <h3>Step 3: Asking Questions</h3>
                <img src="/static/blawx/tutorials/wills/images/jane_question_1.gif" class="d-block w-100"></img>
                <p>Now that we have our fact scenario, we can ask whether jane is eligible to write a will.
                    To do that, we grab a question block with an attacked holds block from the primary drawer.
                    Then we drag the eligible attribute block from the known attributes drawer and add it to the holds block.
                    For the two inputs we choose the true block from the data values drawer, and the jane object selector
                    block from the known objects block.
                </p>
                <p>Having posed the question, we can click "Save" at the top of the screen, and then click "Run" to have blawx
                    answer the question. The answer will be "no models" as there is no way to prove the statement in the question
                    is true. Click on the "Output" tab above to see that the answer is "No models", and then return to the tutorial
                    tab.

                <p>Now let's see what happens when we change Jane's age to 20. Click on the number value block
                    for Jane's age in the facts, and change it to 20. Click "Save", click "Run", and click on the "Output"
                    tab above to see the response. An answer is provided with a natural language explanation, and links
                    to the text of the rule that generated that result.

                <img src="/static/blawx/tutorials/wills/images/blawxbot.gif" class="d-block w-100"></img>
                <p>Now that we have written and tested our code, we can build an app.</p>
                <p>Start by deleting the fact block from your test. This can be done by clicking on the fact block
                    and clicking the "delete" key on your keyboard, or by right-clicking on the fact block and choosing
                    "Delete 6 Blocks."
                </p>
                <p>Now, delete the jane object selector block in the question, and replace it with a named variable. Set the
                    name of the variable to "Someone". Note that the name must start with an uppercase letter.
                </p>
                <p>Click "Save", and click "Bot". This will start a blawxbot user interface. If you give the answers "yes", "jane",
                    "yes", and "20" in that order, (note that they all must be lowercase), Blawxbot will answer that Jane is
                    eligible to make a will, and explain why.

                <p>You have completed the Blawx tutorial!</p>
                <p>Hopefully this tutorial has given you an idea how you can use Blawx to encode the terms
                    used in legislation, encode the rules expressed in that legislation, test that encoding,
                    and then use that encoding to power applications.
