                <p>On the left of the screen you should see a navigation tree that shows you the sections of legislation
                    that you will be encoding. The navigation tree can be hidden and revealed by clicking on its right
                    border, like this.</p>

                <p>Inside the navigation tree are radio buttons that allow you to choose the section you want to work
                    on. For this tutorial, there are only two sections, the root, and section 1.</p>

                <h3>The Encoding Process</h3>
                <p>There are four steps in the encoding process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Encode the vocabulary of your law</li>
                    <li>Use that vocabulary to encode facts, and rules</li>
                    <li>Test your code</li>
                    <li>Use your code</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This tutorial will take you through all of those steps.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Encoding Vocabulary</h3>
                <p>Blawx models the vocabulary of your law using categories and attributes. You create categories
                    (like “dog”) with attributes (like “size” and “colour”), and then you can use those to describe
                    objects (like “clifford”) with values (like “big” and “red”).</p>

                <p> Open the navigation tree, and select section 1. It reads “A person over the age of 18 may make a
                    will.”</p>

                <p> We will model this as a single category for people, and two attributes for age and whether the
                    user is entitled to make a will.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: The Person Category</h3>
                <p>To start, open the “Primary” drawer and drag a fact block onto the workspace.</p>

                <p> Then open the “Categories” drawer and drag a new category block onto the workspace.</p>

                <p> Now change the text in the new category block to read “person”. Note that it must start with a
                    lowercase letter.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: The Age Attribute</h3>
                <p>Now we need to describe for Blawx that the category of Person has an attribute called “age”.</p>
                <img src="/static/blawx/tutorials/wills/images/age_attribute.gif" class="d-block w-100"></img>

                <p> Start by dragging a category attribute block from the Categories drawer, and adding it below the
                    new category block. To tell this block what category we are adding attributes to, open the Known Categories drawer
                    and connect the “person” category selector block.</p>

                <p> To create the age attribute, open the “categories” drawer, drag out a new attribute block and
                    put it inside the category attribute block. Then change the text for the name of the attribute from “attribute name” to “age”. Note that it
                    must start with a lowercase letter.</p>

                <p> Next, to indicate that the values in the age attribute should be numbers, open the “Data Types” drawer of the toolbox, and drag out and connect
                    the “Number” datatype selector block.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="p-4 d-block w-100">
                <h3>Step 1: The Eligible Attribute</h3>
                <p>Now we need to describe for Blawx that the category of Person has an attribute called “eligible”.
                </p>
                <img src="/static/blawx/tutorials/wills/images/eligible_attribute.gif" class="d-block w-100"></img>

                <p> To create the “eligible” attribute, open the “categories” drawer, and drag a new attribute block
                    and put it inside the existing category attribute block below the “age” new attribute block. Now change the text for the name of the attribute from “attribute name” to “eligible”. Note that
                    it must start with a lowercase letter.</p>

                <p> Next, to indicate that the values in the age attribute should be either true or false, open the “Data Types” drawer of the toolbox, and drag out and connect the “True / False” datatype
                    selector block.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Customizing Attributes</h3>
                <p>If you click on the “Known Attributes” drawer (remember to click “Save” first), you should see
                    these two default blocks.</p>

                <p> PNG</p>

                <p> We will now customize how these blocks appear in the interface, and in explanations, to make
                    them easier to understand.</p>

                <p> Start by dragging two attribute display blocks from the Categories drawer, and placing them
                    directly below each of the two new attribute blocks, like this:</p>

                <p> GIF</p>

                <p> For the attribute display block under the “eligible” attribute, change the value for “Appearing
                    as” to “value, then object”, to indicate that we want the word “true” or “false” to appear
                    before the name of the person object. Then change the text of the three fields to read “it is”,
                    “that”, and “eligible to make a will”, respectively.</p>

                <p> Under the “age” attribute, leave the first text field black, set the second text field to “is”,
                    and set the last text field to “years of age”. Your code should now look like this:</p>

                <p> PNG</p>

                <p> Click the “Save” button at the top of the screen.</p>

                <p> Now click on the “Known Attributes” drawer of the toolbox to see how the attribute blocks have
                    been reformatted to make them easier to read.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="carousel-item">
            <div class="p-4 d-block w-100">
                <h3>Step 2: Encoding Rules</h3>
                <p>Now that we have encoded the vocabulary present in section 1, we can encode the rule in section
                    1. Section 1 reads “A person over the age of 18 may make a will.” Because we have told Blawx
                    about people, ages, and eligibility, we can create a rule that expresses this idea.</p>

                <p> Start by opening the Primary drawer of the toolbox and dragging out an rule block pre-filled
                    with an according to block, like this:</p>

                <p> GIF</p>

                <p> The rule starts with the conditions, and ends with the conclusions. The conditions of our rule
                    are that there is a person over the age of 18. To express that idea in Blawx, we break it into
                    three parts that are possible using the vocabulary provided.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Someone is a person</li>
                    <li>That someone has an age</li>
                    <li>That age is at least 18</li>
                </ul>

                <p> The conclusion can be expressed like this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>That someone is eligible to make a will</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>


        <div class="carousel-item">
            <div class="p-4 d-block w-100">
                <h3>Step 2: Rule Conditions</h3>
                <p>To encode the idea “someone is a person” as a condition, we will use an object category block
                    from the Objects drawer, and add it to the conditions of our rule. We will then take the
                    category selector for the “person” category from the Known Categories drawer, and a named
                    variable from the Variables” drawer, and use them to fill in the inputs in the object category
                    block. We will then change the name of the named Variable to “Someone”. It will look like this:
                </p>

                <p> GIF</p>

                <p> Note that the name of the variable must start with a capital letter.</p>

                <p> To encode the idea “that someone has an age”, we will use the age attribute block we created in
                    the Known Attributes drawer, with two named variable blocks from the Variables drawer, named
                    “Someone” and “Age”, respectively. That looks like this:</p>

                <p> GIF</p>

                <p> To encode the idea “that age is at least 18”, we will use the numerical constraint block from
                    the Data Statements / Number drawer of the toolbox, a named Variable from the variables drawer
                    named “Age”, and a number value from the Data Values drawer set to 18. We will choose “greater
                    than or the same value as” as the comparison type. That looks like this:</p>

                <p> GIF</p>

                <h3>Step 2: Rule Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    To encode the conclusion, that this “someone” is entitled to make a will, we will use the
                    “entitled” attribute block from the Known Attributes drawer, a named variable block named
                    “Someone”, and the True value block from the Data Values drawer, like this:</p>

                <p> GIF</p>

                <p> Your rule should now look like this:</p>
